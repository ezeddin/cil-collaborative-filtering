How to run the code :
-----------------------
To generate the best possible submission, use the command :

python train.py --model=SGDnn

which will first run the SGD+ model and then apply the neural postprocessor.
Because it is difficult to make keras produce reproducible results, we cannot guarantee that the submission file will be exactly the same as the one uploaded on kaggle. The score however should be similar, and the SGD+ model will always generate the same factorizations.


How to generate the plots :
-------------------------
Figure 1 : These plots were generated using the attached excel file (  TODO join excel file). The data in the excel file was extracted from the cross-validation output

Figure 2 : This plot was produced using TODO

Figure 3 : This plot was produced using Matlab and the feedback from the kaggle website.
